@article{medioni1992icp,
	Abstract = {We study the problem of creating a complete model of a physical object. Although this may be possible using intensity images, we here use images which directly provide access to three dimensional information. The first problem that we need to solve is to find the transformation between the different views. Previous approaches either assume this transformation to be known (which is extremely difficult for a complete model), or compute it with feature matching (which is not accurate enough for integration). In this paper, we propose a new approach which works on range data directly and registers successive views with enough overlapping area to get an accurate transformation between views. This is performed by minimizing a functional which does not require point-to-point matches. We give the details of the registration method and modelling procedure and illustrate them on real range images of complex objects.},

@article{dong2013plenopticflow,
	Abstract = { Real-time vision-based navigation is a difficult task largely due to the limited optical properties of single cameras that are usually mounted on robots. Multiple camera systems such as polydioptric sensors provide more efficient and precise solutions for autonomous navigation. They are particularly suitable for motion estimation because they allow one to formulate a linear optimization. These sensors capture the visual information in a more complete form called the plenoptic function that encodes the spatial and temporal light radiance of the scene. The polydioptric sensors are rarely used in robotics because they are usually thought to increase the amount of data produced and require more computational power. This paper shows that these cameras provide more accurate estimation results in mobile robotics navigation if designed properly. It also shows that a plenoptic vision sensor with a resolution ranging from 3 × 3 to 40 × 30 pixels camera, provides higher accuracy than a mono-SLAM running on a 320 × 240 pixels camera. The paper also gives a complete scheme to design usable real-time plenoptic cameras for mobile robotics applications by establishing the link between velocity, resolution and motion estimation accuracy. Finally, experiments on a mobile robot are shown allowing for a comparison between optimal plenoptic visual sensors and single high-resolution cameras. The estimation with the plenoptic sensor is more accurate than a monocular high-definition camera with a processing time 100 times lower. },

@inproceedings{neumann2002polydioptric,
	Abstract = {We examine the influence of camera design on the estimation of the motion and structure of a scene from video data. Every camera captures a subset of the light rays passing though some volume in space. By relating the differential structure of the time varying space of light rays to different known and new camera designs, we can establish a hierarchy of cameras. This hierarchy is based upon the stability and complexity of the computations necessary to estimate structure and motion. At the low end of this hierarchy is the standard planar pinhole camera for which the structure from motion problem is non-linear and ill-posed. At the high end is a camera, which we call the full field of view polydioptric camera, for which the problem is linear and stable. We develop design suggestions for the polydioptric camera, and based upon this new design we propose a linear algorithm for structure-from-motion estimation, which combines differential motion estimation with differential stereo.},

The procedure repeatedly adjusts the weights of the connections in the network so as to minimize a measure of the difference between the actual output vector of the net and the desired output vector. As a result of the weight adjustments, internal `hidden'units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain, and the regularities in the task are captured by the interactions of these units. The ability to create useful new features distinguishes back-propagation from earlier, simpler methods such as the perceptron-convergence procedure1.},
